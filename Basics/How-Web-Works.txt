How Web Works?
When you type a web address into your browser :

    The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on .
    The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client . This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
    If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets .
    The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you.
