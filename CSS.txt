CSS 
Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is the code you use to style your webpage.
It is a style sheet language. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML documents.
<link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
to apply the CSS to your HTML document.
Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
p {
  color: red;
}
selector - p
Declaration - color:red;
Property - color
value - red

    Each rule set (apart from the selector) must be wrapped in curly braces ({}).
    Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its values.
    Within each rule set, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
You can also select multiple types of elements and apply a single rule set to all of them. Include multiple selectors separated by commas.
Element selector 	-	All HTML element(s) of the specified type. - p Selects <p>
ID selector 		-	The element on the page with the specified ID. - #my-id Selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id">
Class selector 		-	The element(s) on the page with the specified class - .my-class Selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class">
Attribute selector  -	The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute - img[src] Selects <img src="myimage.png"> but not <img>
Pseudo-class selector-	The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state - a:hover Selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.

CSS layout is based principally on the box model. Each of the blocks taking up space on your page has properties like this:
    padding, the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text).
    border, the solid line that sits just outside the padding.
    margin, the space around the outside of the element.
padding: Top Right Bottom Left;
