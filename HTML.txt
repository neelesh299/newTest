HTML
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
Attributes 
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. 
Nesting
You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting.
Empty elements
Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. They don't have closing tags.
Anatomy of an HTML document
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
   
  </body>
</html>
    <!DOCTYPE html> — These days no one cares about them, and they are just a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything to work right.
    <html></html> — the <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
    <head></head> — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
    <meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.
    <title></title> — the <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.
    <body></body> — the <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
Marking up text
Headings
Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <h1>–<h6>
Paragraphs
<p> elements are for containing paragraphs of text
Lists
    Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.
    Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.
Each item inside the lists is put inside an <li> (list item) element.
Links
<a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor"
<a href="https://www.google.com">This is a Link</a>
href stands for hypertext reference
