HTML
HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
Attributes 
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
